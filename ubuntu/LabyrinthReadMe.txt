Welcome to labyrinth. Please follow the instructions carefully. This system can be implemented by a junior as long as they now their stuff if the don't please reference this video before using. The skills taught by NetworkChuck are transferable due to coding language. Pay attention at the bit where voldemort.py and decryption.py have their parameters set.

So as you can see this is an experimental python defense system, where you set the parameters, using watchdog observer you can change what is the trigger for the automatic encryption.
The encryption itself you have to declare the decryption file so as to not encrypt it.
The decryption I left as a manual file to be executed to automate this you need to pair it using the same top data set which is missing on the bottom with your systems clear verification scanner. So once the network has been scanned and declared clear by manual input, watchtower, carbon black etc it then decrypts the system.
